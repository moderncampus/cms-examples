# XML Upload Using API

This is a simple example on using the CMS API to upload an XML file to a CMS site.
To use it, just replace the placeholder variables at the bottom with the real values.
Ex. replace `[SKIN]` with `oucampus`, `[SITE]` with `www`, etc.

## Functions

For simplicity, this code breaks down the upload process into two functions: cmsLogin and uploadXML

### cmsLogin

This uses the `/authentication/login` API call to login to the CMS.
It needs the skin, account, username, and password for the desired CMS instance and returns a token, which is needed for most API calls.

### uploadXML

This uses the `/files/upload` API call to upload an XML file to the CMS.
It needs a token (which is generated by cmsLogin), the site to upload to, a local path to the XML file, and the path to upload to in the CMS.

xmlPath should end with the xml file. Ex. `dir/to/file.xml`
uploadPath should point to a directory - ensure the directory exists, or the API call may fail quietly. Ex. `/resources/documents`

The function will then read the XML file, convert it into a binary object of type `text/xml` and pass it to the API to be uploaded to the uploadPath.
